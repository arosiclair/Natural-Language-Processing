ALL PYTHON SCRIPTS ARE WRITTEN IN VERSION 2.7.11

Most of the Python apps are self explainatory:

  1. 'LanguageModelBuilder.py' will prompt for the training corpus file and build 
  the language model file (LanguageModel.txt) and top bigram file (TopBigrams.txt) 
  for part 2.2.1
  
  2. 'BigramQueryApp.py' is the Bigram Query Application for part 2.2.2. It will 
  also prompt for the training corpus.
  
  3. 'LanguageModelEvaluator.py' is the Language Model Evaluator application for 
  part 2.2.3. It will prompt for the training and test corpora.
  
  4. 'LanguageModel.py' is a Python class. Do not run this
