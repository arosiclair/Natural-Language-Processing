Unknown words in the Frequency Tagger:
  I tried an implementation for handling unknown words in the unknownWordTag
  function of freq-tagger.py. It looks at probabilities of capitalized words, 
  words ending in -ed, and words containing a number. However, using this 
  almost always produces a 'UH' tag prediction. This is probably because I
  wasn't able to figure out what Pr(unk|tagj). This implementation isn't used
  by default because of this. The function call is commented out.

HMM Tagger:
  The HMM tagger program runs and produces tag predictions, but all of them are
  NNP. I wasn't able to figure out the source of this issue in time.
